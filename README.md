# capstone-project-

#the task is to plot an optimal path from the corner of a virtual maze to the center of the maze .the goal of the project is to #make an autonomous virtual robot which can gain information about the structure of a maze and then learn to make decisions which #lead 
#to a goal in the fastest time possible. The robot should be able to keep the track of its position in the maze, discover walls, #dead ends, block the dead ends & detect the goal.  The robot must map out the maze and discover the possible paths to a goal, then #it should utilize its learning to find the optimal path for reaching the goal in shortest time. The robot will make two runs in #each maze to complete the task. The first run is for exploration where the robot will gain information about the structure of the #maze, learn all the possible routes to the goal, and find an optimal path to the goal. It will try to explore as much unexplored #area as it can. The robot must reach the goal in order to register a successful run around the maze. It should also continue to #explore the maze after reaching the goal if it hasnâ€Ÿt explored enough maze area. In the second run, the robot will resume from the #starting position and attempt to follow the optimal path & reach the goal in fastest time possible using what it has learned in #the first run.
